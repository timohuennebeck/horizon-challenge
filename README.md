## Challenge:

Dear candidate,

To help us evaluate your skills better, we would like to propose a little technical challenge for you.

Horizon Alpha Technical Test

Create a simple app using React and react-router.
Write it in Typescript (extra points for a strict ruleset).
Use your preferred state manager (Redux, Mobx, React Context etcâ€¦) and hold a central application state.
Choose the build tool you prefer.
Write a minimum of clean css or use styled-components.
Write at least two tests using JEST.
Create a README.md file with some documentation.
Use TheMovieDatabase API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get data.

The app should contain:
A home page listing movie categories
A category page listing movies of the category
A detail page of an item with more information about that movie

Nice-to-have features:
Pagination as infinite scrolling
Server Side Rendering
Live search

If you have any questions please ask.
